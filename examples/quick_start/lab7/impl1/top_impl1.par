Number of Signals: 62

Pin Constraint Summary:
   4 out of 4 pins locked (100% locked).

The following 1 signal is selected to use the primary clock routing resources:
    clk_c (driver: clk, clk load #: 13)

WARNING - par: Signal "clk_c" is selected to use Primary clock resources. However, its driver comp "clk" is located at "C1", which is not a dedicated pin for connecting to Primary clock resources. General routing has to be used to route this signal, and it might suffer from excessive delay or skew.

The following 1 signal is selected to use the secondary clock routing resources:
    u1/key_edge_0 (driver: u1/SLICE_14, clk load #: 0, sr load #: 10, ce load #: 0)

Signal rst_c is selected as Global Set/Reset.

*****************************************************************
Info: NBR allows conflicts(one node used by more than one signal)
      in the earlier iterations. In each iteration, it tries to  
      solve the conflicts while keeping the critical connections 
      routed as short as possible. The routing process is said to
      be completed when no conflicts exist and all connections   
      are routed.                                                
Note: NBR uses a different method to calculate timing slacks. The
      worst slack and total negative slack may not be the same as
      that in TRCE report. You should always run TRCE to verify  
      your design.
