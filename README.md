# STEP-MXO2 Development Board
The STEP-MXO2 Dev Board is a small, breadboard friendly 40-pin DIP form factor board built around Lattice MachXO2 FPGA. 
The board includes 
a USB-JTAG programming circuit, clock source,
two digital displays, 
three RGB LEDs, 
four push buttons, 
eight LEDs, 
four switches, 
one hard-core SPI, 
one I2C, 
and basic I/O devices. 
These components make it a formidable, compact, platform for digital logic circuits and Micro32 embedded soft-core processor designs using Lattice Diamond development software. 
There are 36 Digital FPGA I/O signals (30 GPIOs, four dual-functional pins default to SPI interface, 
and two dual-functional pins default to I2C interface) that are routed to 100-mil-spaced through-hole pins so that you can integrate your programmable design directly into a solderless breadboard circuit. 
At just 0.72 inch by 2.05 inch, it can be loaded in a standard socket and used in embedded systems.
